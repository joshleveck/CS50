CS50 Problem Sets

These are only the files that I have coded. There are other files that help the code preform its proper function. The other files are from the CS50 team.

Week 1 creates a Super Mario like obstacle with '#'. 
  This file can run on its own.

Week 2 - Cipher creates a coded message with 26 characters inputted by the user. It then maps the alphabet to the characters and codes the message based off of that.
  This file can run on its own.
  
Week 2 - Readability creates a Grade level of a piece of text input by the user. It does this by averaging how long the words are and how many sentences are in each word 
  and multiplying by a fixed value.
  This file can run on its own.

Week 3 - Plurality and Tideman both are calculating the votes of n number of canidadates. Plurality is based off who get the most votes and Tideman is a ranked voting system 
  that is a little more complicated.
  These files can run on their own.
  
Week 4 - Helpers takes an image imput and applies a filter to it. There are 4 filters: Grayscale, Reflect, Blur, and Edges. Which each do what you would think. Edges detects 
  the edges of an object in a photo. The point of this program is to develop an understanding of arrays.
  This file cannot run on its own.
  
Week 5 - Dictionary takes a dictionary and a text document and compares them. If a word is not in the dictionary it prints it and then counts the number of "misspelled" words.
  The point of this program was to develop a fast algorithm that comparing the two wouldn't be too slow of a process.
